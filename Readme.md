# Fancy shortcodes Updateservice

I just put this online, because it's actually a generic approach for wordpress plugins in terms of automatic updates.
If you ever want to publish your wp-plugins and also offer updating, this is one way to do it.


## Notes

* Put your compressed updated plugin (*.zip) into the update folder
* Add a new package to packages.php
* See autoupdate-class in repository "fancy-shortcodes"


## Checklist

* Looks fine for now...
